This project is a test suite for the Wf4Ever Research Object API, first protoype, using DropBox for the user interface.


== Test outline ==

At this stage, I propose to implement some basic tests that operate on a DropBox 
folder as simple BASH shell scripts and RDF command-line tools, according to the 
main scenario described at 
http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/Research+Objects+Store+and+Retrieve+Service.


1. Test create research object

- create manifest.rdf file in dropbox directory
- wait
- read back manifest: look for additional SRS metadata added


2. Add data to RO

- create new data file in dropbox directory for existing RO
- wait
- read back manifest: look for updated ORE description


3. Modify data in RO

- update existing data file in dropbox directory for existing RO
- wait
- read back manifest: look for updated ORE description metadata


4. Delete data in RO

- delete existing data file in dropbox directory for existing RO
- wait
- read back manifest: look for updated ORE description with component removed


5. Test modify research object metadata

- write new manifest.rdf for existing RO to change descriptive metadata
- wait
- look for indication that change has been noted by SRS (how?)


6. Test create new research object version

- write new manifest.rdf for existing RO with existing data to change version ID
- modify data file in dropbox directory
- wait
- read back manifest: look for updated ORE version


7. Test revert research object version

Following on from test case 6:

- write new manifest.rdf for existing RO to revert version ID
- wait
- read back manifest: look for updated ORE version and metadata
- read back data file: look for reversion to old version content
